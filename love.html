      From the moment you came into my life, everything changed in ways I never
      knew were possible. You are my strength when I feel weak, my calm when the
      world feels loud, and my happiness in every little moment.
      <br><br>
      Loving you is not a choice — it’s the most natural thing my heart has ever
      done. No matter where life takes us, I promise to walk beside you, hold
      your hand in every storm, and celebrate every joy with you.
      <br><br>
      This is not just love. This is my forever, my home, my **you**.💍❤️
