      From the moment you came into my life, everything changed in ways I never
      knew were possible. You are my strength when I feel weak, my calm when the
      world feels loud, and my happiness in every little moment.
      <br><br>
      Getting your dream job is not just your victory, it feels like our victory. I know this is the start of everything we have dreamed about together, and I truly believe we can achieve all the things we once whispered to each other with hope. Thank you so much for being in my life, for loving me, supporting me, and choosing me every day. No matter where life takes us, my heart is with you, my love — today and always. ❤️ <br><br>
      Loving you is not a choice — it’s the most natural thing my heart has ever
      done. No matter where life takes us, I promise to walk beside you, hold
      your hand in every storm, and celebrate every joy with you.
      <br><br>
      This is not just love. This is my forever, my home, my **you**.💍❤️
